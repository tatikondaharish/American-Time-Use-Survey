# American-Time-Use-Survey

* Downloaded data set from https://www.kaggle.com/bls/american-time-use-survey
* The file uses the comma-separated values format: the first line is a header defining the field names of each column, and every following line contains an information record, which is itself made of several columns. It contains information about how people spend their time (e.g., sleeping, eating, working, etc.). 

* Goal is to identify three groups of activities:
   * primary needs (sleeping and eating),
   * work
   * other (leisure).
   * Observe how do people allocate their time between these three kinds of activities, and if we can see differences between      men and women, employed and unemployed people, and young (less than 22 years old), active (between 22 and 55 years old)        and elder people.
